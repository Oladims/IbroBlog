> As a Software developer, I am sure we‘ve all had to learn a new skill one time or the other either for work, personal project or self-development. When faced with a challenge while learning this new skill, How do you face those challenges? How do you react to those challenges? What did you gain from those challenges? Did you see it as a stepping stone or a major BLOCKER that you can’t overcome?

In this post, I will be talking about my most recent challenging learning experience and how I turned it to a stepping stone which has not only made me a better software developer but also a better version of my previous self😎😎😎 .

You must be wondering, what’s this challenge?

**Learning** to write  **Backend** codes, **Node-Js** to be precise😭😭😭.

---------

As a Developer, I have always been attracted to working on the things a User can see/feel while using an application, which is why I chose to be a Front-end developer and try as much as possible to run from anything the user cannot see (backend of the application) if only I knew.

After weeks of screening, series of code challenge, and Interview. I finally made it to Andela’s Bootcamp programme🎉🎉🎉(where everything changed). We were asked to create a full-stack project(Front-end😎 + Back-end😭 = 😨).

Now I had to learn how to write backend code for my app. At first, my morale was down before I discovered these 5 steps 👇 to overcoming a challenge.

1.  **The power of perspective:** I saw a tweet from one of my favorite developers 

> When feeling overwhelmed by a faraway goal, repeat the following: I
> have it within me right now, to get me to where I want to be later
> @unicodeveloper

The first thing that changed after reading this tweet was my perspective, then I started seeing learning Node-js as

1.  A learning opportunity.
2.  A challenge to overcome and make me stronger.
3.  An opportunity to become a full-stack developer.
4.  The stepping stone I need to access the opportunity(becoming an Andelan) waiting to be explored.

2.  **Ask the right individuals:**  I called a developer friend of mine who is  **competent** at using Node-js, then  **asked**  for learning resources and advice on how I can  **overcome** this challenge within the stipulated time.

3.  **Thrive on your strengths:**  Every developer has a certain  way of learning that works for them perfectly. Some of us are great with docs, others are videos, articles… Knowing myself to be the article and video kinda guy, I watched and read every article I felt could help achieve my goal.

4.  **Keep the fun and enjoyment:** A wise man on twitter once said: “There’s more to life than coding… Take a break”. This a very important thing most people tend to overlook. Whenever I feel tired or stuck on a problem I take a break either to see a movie, hang out with friends or read a book.

5.  **Resolve://to.never/ever/ever/give-up:** Do not give up no matter how hard it might be at that moment just like Kevin Hart didn’t give up in Night School😉.

> “A man on a thousand mile walk has to forget his goal and say to himself every morning, ‘Today I’m going to cover twenty-five miles and then rest up and sleep.”  
> ―  **Leo Tolstoy,** [**War and Peace**](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/4912783)

Every challenge you face today is your twenty-five miles to achieving your thousand-mile goal.

## Thank you ….
